# Sales Decision Factors Analysis

This project identifies key factors influencing customer purchase decisions using factor analysis. The analysis reveals hidden patterns in customer behavior, providing insights that go beyond standard predictive models.

## Project Overview

Imagine you're a data scientist in a retail environment. Your goal is to discover what drives customers to make purchasing decisions. In this project, factor analysis is applied to a sales dataset to uncover latent factors influencing buying behavior.

## Files

- **dataset.csv**: Contains customer purchase data, including purchase frequency, average amount spent, store time, and app usage.
- **sales_proj.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the code and analysis using Python’s `FactorAnalyzer` package.
